    <description>Hey there kids, are you tired of the game telling you to end your funny 1 fps run, by giving you a bajillion useless breakfasts? Are you irritated by the sheer concept of breakfasting in general?
Introducing: Glitchfast! These delicious items are a great calorie free substitute to breakfasts.
No more, will you have to drink anymore of that horrific, spoilt milk. You too, can now take the phrase &quot;gamebreak&quot; literally! Plus, it's also a slight reference to flash isaac, and who doesn't love that?
